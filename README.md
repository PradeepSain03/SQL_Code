## Introduction to SQL
- What is SQL?
- History and evolution of SQL.
- SQL standards (e.g., ANSI SQL).

## SQL Syntax
- Structure of SQL statements (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- SQL keywords and their usage (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY).

## Data Definition Language (DDL)
- CREATE TABLE statement.
- ALTER TABLE statement (adding, modifying, dropping columns).
- DROP TABLE statement.

## Data Types
- Common data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE, DECIMAL).
- Choosing appropriate data types for columns.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- INSERT statement.
- UPDATE statement.
- DELETE statement.

## Querying Data
- SELECT statement (SELECT columns, SELECT *).
- Filtering data using WHERE clause.
- Sorting data using ORDER BY clause.
- Limiting and paging results using LIMIT and OFFSET clauses.

## Aggregate Functions
- AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX().
- Using aggregate functions with GROUP BY clause.

## Joins
- Understanding different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).
- Using aliases for table names.

## Subqueries
- Nested SELECT statements.
- Using subqueries in WHERE, SELECT, and FROM clauses.

## Constraints
- NOT NULL constraint.
- UNIQUE constraint.
- PRIMARY KEY constraint.
- FOREIGN KEY constraint.
- CHECK constraint.

## Indexes
- What are indexes?
- Creating indexes.
- Using indexes to improve query performance.

## Transactions
- What is a transaction?
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Using transactions (BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

## Views
- Creating views.
- Modifying views.
- Using views in SELECT statements.

## Stored Procedures and Functions
- Creating stored procedures.
- Calling stored procedures.
- Creating functions (scalar functions, table-valued functions).

## Normalization
- What is normalization?
- Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- Benefits of normalization.
